# PersonalProjects
In this repository, you will find content from different programming languages, all related to personal projects
that I have worked on in my free time.

This project is designed to control the cursor using facial movements and perform actions with facial gestures.
When you open your mouth,it takes a screenshot, when you blink, it performs a click, and when you raise your eyebrow,
it exits the application.

This project was developed using PyCharm and a webcam
